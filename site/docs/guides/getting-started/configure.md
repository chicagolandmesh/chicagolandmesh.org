#### Router Client Mode (Recommended for Fixed Nodes)
   - Router Client mode allows the node to act as both a router and a client, helping to extend the mesh networkâ€™s reach.
   - Set up Router Client mode on fixed nodes that are strategically placed to extend network coverage, such as those placed in attics or outdoors with larger antennas.

#### Client Mode (Recommended for Mobile Nodes)
   - Client mode is suitable for mobile nodes like handheld devices that move within the mesh network.
   - Mobile nodes typically only need to be set up as clients to connect to nearby nodes and relay messages.
