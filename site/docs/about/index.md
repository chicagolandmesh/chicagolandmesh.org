## What is Meshtastic?

[MeshtasticÂ®](https://meshtastic.org) is a community project that allows 
anybody to communicate over LoRa radios serving as a decentralized 
communications platform. Learn more about the interworkings through the
[documentation](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview).

- Long range ([254km record by kboxlabs](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/range-tests/#current-ground-record-254km))
- Decentralized communication - no dedicated router required
- Encrypted communication
- Excellent battery life
- Send and receive text messages between members of the mesh
- Optional GPS based location features

## What is Chicagoland Mesh?

We are a growing community of people working together to create an off-grid resilient communications network using inexpensive LoRa devices. Operating within unlicensed 915MHz frequency, these devices are loaded with the Meshtastic firmware automatically connecting with eachother. 

Meshtastic does not require you to have a HAM license and operates in unlicensed frequency meaning that it can be encrypted and your messages will remain secure from prying eyes.

The purpose of Chicagoland Mesh is to expand coverage in our area and build out the network to make it more usable. We currently have a number of nodes located in downtown Chicago and on top of other buildings out in the suburbs. We are always looking to expand our coverage and rely on ourselves and others who can get nodes in high up places to join us in building our off-grid communications network.
